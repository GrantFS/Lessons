# HTML Tags

HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets. <p>
HTML tags normally come in pairs like <p> and </p>

The first tag in a pair is the start tag, 
The second tag is the end tag.

The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name

# HTML elements

An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:

# Examples

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

The <head> tag contains metadata 
(document title, character set, styles, links, scripts), 
specific information about the web page that is not displayed to the user. 

# Metadata

Metadata provides browsers and search engines with technical information about the web page.


The <body> tag defines the document's body. 
The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc


The <footer> element is a structural element used to identify the footer of a page, 
document, article, or section. A <footer> typically contains copyright and authorship information 
or navigational elements pertaining to the contents of the parent element
