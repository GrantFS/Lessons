# Bootstrap versions

Bootstrap 3 works in a smiliar way to Bootstrap 4.

Differences:
There is no col- this is col-xs-
There is no col-lg

So the devices work as

col-xs - Mobile
col-sm - Tablet
col-md - Laptop
col-lg - Retina Laptop

This has many drawbacks as devices now have higher pixels hence the change in bootstrap 3 to bootstrap 4
