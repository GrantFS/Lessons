                Devon is renowned for an assortment of things such as its spectacular coastline, beautiful beaches and of course the Devonshire cream tea, all making it a popular holiday destination. It is also the only county in England that has two National Parks and
                the only county in the UK to have a non-continuous coastline on both the north and south.

                You will find the glorious county of Devon lying in the heart of South West England, bordered by Dorset, Somerset and Cornwall.

                A brief history of Devon
            </div>
            <p>
                Human remains have previously been discovered in Kents Cavern in Torquay, dating back an estimated 30,000-40,000 years and it is thought that Dartmoor was inhabited by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers as far back as 6000 BC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Devon’s name comes from the word Dumnonia, as it was once home to the Dumnonni Celts during the British Iron Age and Roman Britain, and is thought to mean ‘deep valley dwellers’. The Celtic region flourished for almost 500 years, although there were constant
                threats of invasions from the Anglo-Saxons, with many battles taking place against the West Saxons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, the Kings of Dumnonia are thought to have withdrawn to safer strongholds in Cornwall and Devon had its first mention in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in AD 823. The area was originally part of the Wessex Sees of Winchester and then Sherborne but
                it was given its own Bishop in AD 905, which was based at Bishop's Tawton, though quickly transferred to Crediton.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following King William the Conqueror’s invasion in 1066, he quickly recognised the importance of securing the West Country and divided the rich farmland up amongst his Norman Barons. Since his reign, there were a number of further battles affecting Devon
                throughout the centuries, including the Civil War of King Steven, coastal attacks by the French and the Prayer Book Rebellion.

                Devon holds a special place in my heart. As a child, I normally went on holiday to Bantham and have lots of happy memories from my time there. I used to catch sand eels in the early morning and go fishing for bass throughout the day. I remember a gull
                taking my bait.
